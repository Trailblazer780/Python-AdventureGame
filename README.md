# PROG 1700 (Introduction to Programming) Project 3
## Adventure Game

This program is a simple adventure game that ends up with 3 different endings depending on the choices you make. This game does file IO and you
can save your game and come back to it later. It will write out to a text file that is located in the same folder that the .py file is in.

## How to use:
1. Press 1 to start a new game or press 2 to load a saved game or press 3 to quit.
2. You are given 2 options to pick from so you can pick option 1 or option 2 and input that number. If you want to save put 3 and press enter.
3. The game has 3 endings and your choices influence what ending you come to, some are earlier than others. Have fun!
